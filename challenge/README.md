# App reversing - Have a smiley day! :)

## Part 1

A secondary phone was found in KALLESTAD, Jesper's boat.
Data was successfully extracted from the phone, but nothing incriminating was found.

Officers did however come across this strange app which seemingly serves no purpose.
The app cannot be found on the app store, so it may be worth taking a look at.

Reverse engineer the app ``smiley_day.apk`` to see if any hidden functionality may be uncovered.

## Part 2

Keep digging through the Smiley Day app and crack the password to unlock the secret data.

Note: It is neither neccessary nor feasible to perform online brute force of the password.

Flag format: The password itself is the flag for this challenge.
